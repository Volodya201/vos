# VOS - programming language you need

## Why it exist?

Idk, I just randomly start making it

## What does "vos" stands for?

vos - VoOneScript

VoOne is one of my nicknames

And by the way vos sound like voice a little bit and I and my friend like call voice like this, so when I realized that VoOneScript is "VOS", I immediately picked this name

## What are the possibilities of vos

If I dont forget to change this, it is version 1.1.0 (I havent forgotten yet)

Now you can do much more than in 1.0.0:

-   create and read variables
-   init and call functions
-   use built-in print function to output things
-   add, subtract, multiply and divide
-   concat strings
-   see beauty of lexer and parser

Star it to not lose and get new update üëçüëçüëç

## How I can use it?

Easily.

-   Install node.js

-   Download this repository

-   Type in cmd "**node main.js_location your_vos_file**" (you can find example script.vos in repository)

-   Remember you can always add space and "true" like this: "node main.js script.vos **true**" to see some logs with tokens and parsing
